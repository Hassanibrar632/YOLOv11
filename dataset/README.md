# YOLOv11 Dataset

This directory contains example data for training YOLOv11 on the HIT-UAV dataset. It includes sample images, labels, and a dataset configuration file.

## Files Overview
- **`images/`**: Contains a few example images from the dataset.
- **`labels/`**: Contains corresponding label files for the example images.
- **`dataset.yaml`**: The dataset configuration file used by YOLOv11 for training.
- **`This is example dataset.txt`**: A placeholder file indicating that this is not the full dataset.

## Important Notes
- **This is not the full dataset.** This directory contains only a small subset of images and labels for example and explanation purposes.
- **Dataset Configuration Warning:** You must make specific changes in the `dataset.yaml` file before training. The required modifications are detailed in the `YOLOv11_Trainning.ipynb` notebook found in the main directory.
